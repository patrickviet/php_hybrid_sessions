php_hybrid_sessions
===================

Hybrid local - distant session system for PHP



HOWTO
=====
- run the daemon on servers
- configure a central memcache
- include the session handler

TODO
====
- have the perl and php read a unique config file
- do more testing
- write GC (a foreach)

Case not resolved: back and forward.
Must have some kind of notification in case of server that goes back and forward
